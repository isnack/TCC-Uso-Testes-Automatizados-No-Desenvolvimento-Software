\par \textit{Nowadays there is a great demand of software development and with this the final user requires a system with the least amount of defects possible. In this context was made a demonstration and usage of automated tests of softwares through the TDD method, which shows how the tests help to deliver a quality system and with a minimal rate of errors. During the research a web payroll was developed and through it all the automated tests proposed by this application
were applied. Used alongside the automated tests was the continuous
integration, which in every new improvement in the system aims to verify if all the tests will pass once more or if they will break the build, and the cover report which assists the developer to visualize the cover rate of the code and which part of the system needs more tests. The use of these tools only add and help in the process of software development because it has fast feedback which facilitates in the detection and solution of problems and aims to produce a system with the lowest error rates. This academic project was developed through applied research aiming to optimize the final result, with the objective to resolve specific problems identified during all the tests development.}
